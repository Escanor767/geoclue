      org.freedesktop.GeoClue2.Agent:
      @short_description: The GeoClue agent interface

      This is the interface all application-authorizing agents must implement.
      There must be a separate agent object for every logged-in user on path
      "/org/freedesktop/GeoClue2/Agent".

        AuthorizeApp:
        @desktop_id: The desktop file id (the basename of the desktop file) of the application requesting location information.
        @req_accuracy_level: The level of location accuracy requested by client, as <link linkend="GClueAccuracyLevel">GClueAccuracyLevel</link>.
        @authorized: Return value indicating if application should be given location information or not.
        @allowed_accuracy_level: The level of location accuracy allowed for client, as <link linkend="GClueAccuracyLevel">GClueAccuracyLevel</link>.

        This is the method that will be called by geoclue to get applications
        authorized to be given location information. Deprecated in favor of

        @location: User/agent can use this to dictate location to be given to user, although currently it's completely ignored and is only added here for future safety. Format is latitiude, longitude, accuracy (in meters).

        The global maximum level of accuracy allowed for all clients. Since
